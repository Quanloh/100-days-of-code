# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 6 Aug 2018

**Today's Progress:** Restarted the Freecodecamp curriculum after I "drop out" last time. As I forgot most of the thing, I will just restart the whole thing. 

Went through the basic html and html5, started basic css, and stop before things about borders. Took about 1 hour and 15 minutes.

**Thoughts:** Good start, I can do this!
